## Reflection

This was a 3 week long project built during my initial learning stage of Front End Web development. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

The technologies implemented in this project are HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Axios. The database used is from TMDB API.
